Latentscape is an exploration of imaginary and virtual landscape. Heightmaps are generated by GANs trained with custom datasets and then prepared and rendered into Unreal Engine as 3D terraformation. While the concepts of map and border appear as mere theoretical and functional superstructure, the landscapes and territories with their nuances, inlets, breaks, colors and topological diversity depict the meeting of human data in the border points, marking the landmarks of meeting and fusion of thoughts, feelings and experiences. Collectors of the diptych will receive the original 15360x15360 300dpi masters.

A 50x50cm printed version on hahnemuhle photo matt fibre 200gsm for the entire dyptich or the single copy can be requested before purchase.
